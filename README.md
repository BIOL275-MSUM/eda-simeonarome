Abstract

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the
newly discovered coronavirus. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily
through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected
person coughs or sneezes. In the Us COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by
the WHO in March 2020. What is the effect of rate of hospitalization due
to COVID-19 in the spread of the virus? In this study we are going to
evaluate this question using Texas as a case study. with the aid of
exploratory data analysis, we are going to compare the hospitalization
rates and then compare it to the number of deaths recorded. From the
results of this data analysis, I should be able to conclude that that
increased hospitalization either increases or decreases the spread of
Covid in Texas

Introduction

Methods Data Acquisition’ The data for this project was gathered from
covid data tracking website through the Lab website for Quantitative
Biology. This website ’’ The COVID Tracking Project’’,
covidtracking.com/data/state/texas contained relevant covid statistics
fro all the 50 states in the country. I did not have to request access
for thsi website, I just had to click the link, copy it into R Studio
and run it with the read csv function
