## ABSTRACT

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In the Us COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. What is the effect of rate of hospitalization due to COVID-19 in the spread of the virus? In this study we are going to evaluate this question using Texas as a case study. with the aid of exploratory data analysis, we are going to compare the hospitalization rates and then compare it to the number of deaths recorded. From the results of this data analysis, I should be able to conclude that that increased hospitalization either increases or decreases the spread of Covid in Texas or show no correlation at all.

## Introduction

Exactly one year after COVID-19 pandemic hit most part of the United States, there has yet to be a cure for this virus. It is also unknown how much the mortality rates is affected by hospitalization. IT is important to know if hospitalizing patients help parents recover. We put this into consideration as there is no cure in hospitals that would necessarily confer any type of advantage of hospitalization. What is the correlation between the rate of hospitalization and the death rate in Texas.Did hospitalization influence the death rate positively or negatively?, or no correlation at all?

## Methods

### Data Acquisition

The data for this project was gathered from covid data tracking website through the Lab website for Quantitative Biology.

This website '' The COVID Tracking Project at Atlantic''(Atlantic covid tracking, 2021) contained relevant covid statistics fro all the 50 states in the country. I did not have to request access for this website, I just had to click the link, copy it into R Studio and run it with the read csv function.

### Data Description

Each row in this data represent a day in the state of Texas. Data is recorded everyday since the 3rd of March 2020 till the 7th of March 2021.The columns in the data represent the different statistical variables in our data. The three variables used in this data were the death, death increase and hospitalized currently

### Data Preparation

In this project we used Rstudio (R Core Team, 2021) to clean up and prepare our data. First we loaded the tidyverse package (wickham et al, 2019) and we and we used the read_csv function to load our data into RStudio. We used the ggplot function to make pictorial representations of our data through histograms, time series and line graphs.

## Results

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
coviddata_texas <-
  read_csv('https://covidtracking.com/data/download/texas-history.csv')
```

The figures below (Figure 1) are histograms which represent the (a)frequency distribution of the number of hospitalized patients, (b)cumulative number of deaths and (c) daily increase in the number of deaths

```{r}

ggplot(data = coviddata_texas) +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x = hospitalizedCurrently),
    bins = 15,
    fill = "pink",
    color = "black"
  ) +
  labs(x = "Number of People Hospitalized", y = "Frequency (Number Of Days)") 

ggplot(data = coviddata_texas) +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x = death),
    bins = 15,
    fill = "pink",
    color = "black"
  ) +
  labs(x = "Cumulative number of Deaths", y = "Frequency (Number Of Days)") 

ggplot(data = coviddata_texas) +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x = deathIncrease),
    bins = 15,
    fill = "pink",
    color = "black"
  ) +
  labs(x = "Daily Increase in the Number of Deaths", y = "Frequency (Number Of Days)") 

```

The figures, (Figure 2) below represent a time series of number of (a) hospitalized patients, (b)cumulative number of deaths and (c)daily increase in the number of deaths

```{r}
ggplot(data = coviddata_texas) +
  geom_area(mapping = aes(x = date, y=death),fill='blue')
ggplot(data = coviddata_texas) +
  geom_area(mapping = aes(x = date, y=deathIncrease),fill='blue')
ggplot(data = coviddata_texas) +
  geom_area(mapping = aes(x = date, y=hospitalizedCurrently),fill='blue')

```

The figures (Figure 3) below represent a line graph of number of (a)hospitalized patients, (b)cumulative number of deaths and (C)daily increase in the number of deaths

```{r}
ggplot(data = coviddata_texas) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = date, y=death),fill='blue')
ggplot(data = coviddata_texas) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = date, y=deathIncrease),fill='blue')
ggplot(data = coviddata_texas) +
geom_line(mapping = aes(x = date, y=hospitalizedCurrently),fill='blue')

```

## DISCUSSION

In figure 1 above, we have three histograms where we can visualize the frequency of the number of people hospitalized daily, the cumulative number of deaths and the daily increase in death toll. We can infer from our histogram that regardless of the trend in data for the hospitalized patients there was a slow decline in death rate. This can be properly visualized by comparing each bars on the histogram on (a) nd (b), the histogram distribution on graph (C) represents the daily death increase which reduces steadily across the graph.

In figures 2 and 3, we use a time series and line graph show that regardless of an increase or decrease in the rate of hospitalization, there was no significant effect or impact on death rate, as the death rate increased numerically across March 2020 to March 2021. From our results, we reject our hypothesis as there was no correlation whatsoever between hospitalization and death rates in Texas.

The rate of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients in Texas did not have any significant impact on the death rate. THis could be due to lots of factors: there is no known cure for COVID-19, there are also different qualities of healthcare across the state of Texas and so there would be no consistent impact or result of this healthcare on the death toll. In addition, one of the variuables in our data- hospitalization rate is too broad for us to get a clear correlation. This means that in previous studies it would mnore advantageous for us to look at different hospitals specifically to show any existing correlation to mortality rate. Furthermore, we are not aware of the number of non-hospitalized patients that actually died from COVID-19 infection. The wider implication of this results in this study, is that hospitalization of COVID-19 patients have not really played a significant role in the mortality rates in Texas.
